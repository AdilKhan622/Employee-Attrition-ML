# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project uses various Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) to predict whether an employee will leave the company based on HR data.  
It is part of a college course project on Machine Learning.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Multiple model implementations
- Accuracy and performance comparison
- Final report included in `/report`

## Dataset
The dataset used is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset, which contains employee records such as satisfaction level, job role, and performance metrics used to predict attrition.

If the dataset isn’t included, you can download it from:
